Should the arena assume programs are deterministic?

ROB'S PLAN:
1) wrap a dumbass strategy so that it plays according to the file interface
2) make a way of automatically running two stategies 'gainst one another
3) populate strategy submissions/revisions in a database
4) ensure that the two implementations are compatible
5) implement a client-server interaction for automating test running

- Should the arena automatically handle binary creation and storage in 
  a submission-compatible format? (I'm thinking not, at least at first)

- Interaction with the online server?
