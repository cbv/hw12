this is a list of things that are on bblum's mind at 0500 EDT. feel free to add
your own improvements, rebuttals, or whatever.

backup is great. it seems like it works with sniper-with-backup as produced by
joshua, to great effect.

robust-emit is a version of emit-program that
 0 - uses Backup to avoid losing from having its guy get killed
 1 - instead of being told a slot to generate in, picks a slot and "returns" it
 2 - currently only takes one backup, but needs to take incremental ones
 3 - Is not tested but will probably work very well on sniper et al.

the number generator wants:
 1 - support for building a timecube when we get "safely late" into the game
 2 - an interface to build a number in a user-specified slot (useful for sniper)
     - this would fit best with using the timecube; otherwise it would probably
       just be cheapest to compile the number from scratch into the slot

backup, on the other hand, can be enhanced to use the current number generation
scheme, instead of allocating the slot on its own. it would just ask for the
number generator to produce the "src" number in any slot, then apply "Get", and
the backup would be completed. (there is a TODO comment in backup to this
effect, but it would need more than just a few lines to restructure.)

perhaps the sniper should heuristically select its next target not just based on
evaluation of a slot's value but also on how easy a slot number is to calculate
starting from the number that you were previously attacking?
